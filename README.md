# An Implementation of the Deep Q-Learning Algorithm with Tetris

The Deep Q-Learning Algorithm, originally introduced in this [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236), is an extension of the traditional reinforcement algorithm Q-Learning. 

This implementation utilizes Gymnasium, PyTorch, OpenCV, numPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn with a requirements.txt coming soon
